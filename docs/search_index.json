Our analysis specifically focuses on the variables of fielding position and whether a player was drafted in high school or college, and how these differences change a players time from draft to debut. 0.1 Motivation An analysis of the period of time between a players draft date and their MLB debut date can help major league teams better prepare for their future seasons. Among players who reached the majors, we estimated the average length of time between a players latest draft date and their MLB debut date to be 1667 days, or 4.56 years. Therefore, when professional teams are drafting their players, they generally need to be planning for what they want their organization to look and play like at least four to five years later. If these teams have a better idea of how long it usually takes between the draft and debut date for high school players in comparison to college players, they may have a better idea of who to scout and draft when rebuilding their farm system for that future championship team. This planning can additionally be more accurate when taking into account position, and analyzing how there are differences in average time to debut between players at different positions. "],["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Background 1.2 Data Sources 1.3 Data Cleaning", " 1 Introduction 1.1 Background There has been much prior work that has applied survival analysis to baseball, much of it related to predicting career length. Witnauer, Rogers, and Onge studied the career length of baseball players with respect to their age at the start of their career and what decade they played in. Smith and Christensen assessed psychological skills in minor league players and found that they were predictive of current performance and later survival in major league baseball. Besides published research, many others have carried out their own statistical analyses of baseball. The relationship between career length and batting / throwing hand were examined in a blog post by Micah Melling using Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards model. He found that switch hitters had a much higher survival curve than other hitters, and left-handed hitters had slightly higher survival than right-handed hitters. In another interesting analysis, Scott Spencer studied how long a starting pitcher lasts in a game and looked at performance factors such as runs and baserunners allowed. We did not find any previous analyses which examined time to debut of baseball players, which makes this project particularly unique and interesting. 1.2 Data Sources The data set we used for our analysis combined two data sets, one containing information on MLB drafts and another containing information on player debuts. The draft data set has data on drafts between 1965-2019 and can be found here on GitHub . This data itself was compiled from the MLB Data API. The debuts data set lists players debuts between 2005-2019 and was manually put together using data from Baseball Reference. 1.3 Data Cleaning As with any statistical analysis, a significant amount of time was spent getting the data in a usable form. Only the June Amateur Draft is included in our analysis and players drafted since 2005 in order to match the debuts data set. Since far more players are drafted than the number that reach the majors, we left joined the MLB draft data with the debuts data. In addition, because players can be drafted multiple times, we took the most recent draft date for each player. "],["exploration.html", "2 Exploratory Data Analysis", " 2 Exploratory Data Analysis Before we build any models or perform any survival analysis, we will briefly explore the data set and look at how the chance of reaching the majors changes based on different factors. For this part of the project, well mostly look at the subset of players who were drafted from 2000 to 2010 in order to allow sufficient time for players to debut. Out of all the players who were drafted between 2000-2010 and played in the minors, only 18.8% reached the majors. Players drafted in the 1st round had the highest chance at 70.4%, and players drafted in the 2nd round had the second highest chance at 52.7%. The following bar graph shows in detail the proportion of players who reach the majors by round. Next well investigate what proportion of players are drafted out of high school vs college by round. Overall, 32.3% of drafted players are drafted out of high school. The bar graph below shows what proportion of players are drafted from high school vs college by round. Interestingly, we see that the proportion of players drafted out of high school decreases and then increases, with the highest levels in rounds 40-50. This may be because baseball teams are more willingly to take risks in later rounds since the probability of these players reaching the majors is so low anyway. An ongoing debates among baseball analysts and front offices is whether to draft high school or college players. Some believe that only college players should be drafted because of the high amount of uncertainty involved with high schools players, and because teams should minimize risk. However, there appears to be a shift between when it is beneficial to draft college players and when it is beneficial to draft high school players: One explanation for this is that the high risk / high reward of high schoolers is a disadvantage in earlier rounds, by an advantage in later rounds. In earlier rounds the risk of injury and washing out for high school players outweighs the benefit of starting in the minors sooner, but in later rounds starting earlier could be the difference between making it to the big leagues or not. High school players who sign on will be foregoing college and thus will be able to dedicate more time to baseball. Finally, we will investigate the time from draft to debut among players. Here we will be using the debuts data set in addition to the draft data set. Also, we will only consider players drafted from 2005-2010, since 2005 is the earliest year for which we have debut information. From the above density plot, we can see that high school players tend to debut 2-3 years after college players. The distribution within each group is roughly symmetric and unimodal. The mean and median time to debut for all players is 4.63 and 4.23 years respectively. The 95% quantile of debuts times is 8.12 years, which we will use later on in our analysis as a cutoff time for censoring individuals.
