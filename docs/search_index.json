[["index.html", "Survival Analysis Project Overview 0.1 Motivation", " Survival Analysis Project Corey Pieper and Erin Franke 3/10/2021 Overview In this project we conducted a survival analysis of the time from draft date to debut date for major league baseball players. Our analysis specifically focuses on the variables of fielding position and whether a player was drafted in high school or college, and how these differences change a players time from draft to debut. 0.1 Motivation An analysis of the period of time between a players draft date and their MLB debut date can help major league teams better prepare for their future seasons. Among players who reached the majors, we estimated the average length of time between a players latest draft date and their MLB debut date to be 1667 days, or 4.56 years. Therefore, when professional teams are drafting their players, they generally need to be planning for what they want their organization to look and play like at least four to five years later. If these teams have a better idea of how long it usually takes between the draft and debut date for high school players in comparison to college players, they may have a better idea of who to scout and draft when rebuilding their farm system for that future championship team. This planning can additionally be more accurate when taking into account position, and analyzing how there are differences in average time to debut between players at different positions.

This is a survival analysis project, meaning it is a statistical analysis where the response variable being modeled is a length of time from an initiating event (a player being drafted) until a terminating event (the player making their MLB debut). You may be wondering how we account for players that do not debut, as they have no terminating event. These players are known as right censored, which means we have a lower bound on their survival time. Typically in survival analysis these observations are given a status of 0 to denote them as censored and then survival calculations are made with them included in the data. We will discuss how we experimented with this process and why censoring did not necessarily work for what we were trying to accomplish. Another important term that we will use throughout this website is survival curves. A survival curve is a downward sloping curve ranging from 0 to 1 on the y axis, which represents the proportion of the population remaining overtime. Finding the area under a survival curve will give the mean survival time of the population. A Kaplan-Meier curve is a variation of a survival curve that accounts for censored data. When data is right censored, the Kaplan-Meier curve will have a longer mean survival time than the original survival curve. Over the course of this website, we will introduce and explain more complex survival analysis terms including hazard functions, Cox-Snell models, likelihood ratio tests, and others. 1.2 Background There has been much prior work that has applied survival analysis to baseball, much of it related to predicting career length. Witnauer, Rogers, and Onge studied the career length of baseball players with respect to their age at the start of their career and what decade they played in. Smith and Christensen assessed psychological skills in minor league players and found that they were predictive of current performance and later survival in major league baseball. Besides published research, many others have carried out their own statistical analyses of baseball. The relationship between career length and batting / throwing hand were examined in a blog post by Micah Melling using Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards model. He found that switch hitters had a much higher survival curve than other hitters, and left-handed hitters had slightly higher survival than right-handed hitters. In another interesting analysis, Scott Spencer studied how long a starting pitcher lasts in a game and looked at performance factors such as runs and baserunners allowed. We did not find any previous analyses which examined time to debut of baseball players, which makes this project particularly unique and interesting. 1.3 Data Sources The data set we used for our analysis combined two data sets, one containing information on MLB drafts and another containing information on player debuts. The draft data set has data on drafts between 1965-2019 and can be found here on GitHub. This data itself was compiled from the MLB Data API. The debuts data set lists players debuts between 2005-2019 and was manually put together using data from Baseball Reference. 1.4 Data Cleaning As with any statistical analysis, a significant amount of time was spent getting the data in a usable form. Only the June Amateur Draft is included in our analysis and players drafted since 2005 in order to match the debuts data set. Since far more players are drafted than the number that reach the majors, we left joined the MLB draft data with the debuts data. In addition, because players can be drafted multiple times, we took the most recent draft date for each player. Afterwards, we decided to focus our analysis on players who reached the majors rather than all players. We made this decision because only about 1/5 of drafted players who play in the minors make it to the big leagues, so the majority of players do not have debut dates. In the context of survival analysis, these players survive forever, and as a result this will lead to large estimates for things like mean survival time. The fact that most players survive, or never debut, is something that is unique about this analysis since it is often the case that the survival of individuals goes to 0 as time goes to infinity (e.g. survival of patient with a disease or survival of light bulbs). Because of this, it may be hard to see slight differences between groups because survival is so high. The following weibull model demonstrates this: Even after 4000 days, or about 11 years, the model shows that most players still havent debuted, and its hard to distinguish between the survival curves of high school vs college players. We split up our analysis into two components, or a two-phase model. In the first phase, we predicted the probability of a player reaching the majors based on factors such as batting hand, if they were drafted out of high school or college, and their position. In the second phase, we created non-parametric and parametric models of survival considering only players that debuted. Furthermore, we limited our data set of debuted players to those that were drafted between 2005-2011 in order to allow up to 8 years for players to debut (since the debuts data only goes to 2019). The reason we choose 8 years was because this was the 95% quantile of debut times, which we will show in the next section. "],["exploration.html", "2 Exploratory Data Analysis", " 2 Exploratory Data Analysis Before we build any models or perform any survival analysis, we will briefly explore the data set and look at how the chance of reaching the majors changes based on different factors. For this part of the project, well mostly look at the subset of players who were drafted from 2000 to 2010 in order to allow sufficient time for players to debut. Out of all the players who were drafted between 2000-2010 and played in the minors, only 18.8% reached the majors. Players drafted in the 1st round had the highest chance at 70.4%, and players drafted in the 2nd round had the second highest chance at 52.7%. The following bar graph shows in detail the proportion of players who reach the majors by round. Next well investigate what proportion of players are drafted out of high school vs college by round. Overall, 32.3% of drafted players are drafted out of high school. The bar graph below shows what proportion of players are drafted from high school vs college by round. Interestingly, we see that the proportion of players drafted out of high school decreases and then increases, with the highest levels in rounds 40-50. This may be because baseball teams are more willingly to take risks in later rounds since the probability of these players reaching the majors is so low anyway. An ongoing debates among baseball analysts and front offices is whether to draft high school or college players. Some believe that only college players should be drafted because of the high amount of uncertainty involved with high schools players, and because teams should minimize risk. However, there appears to be a shift between when it is beneficial to draft college players and when it is beneficial to draft high school players: One explanation for this is that the high risk / high reward of high schoolers is a disadvantage in earlier rounds, by an advantage in later rounds. In earlier rounds the risk of injury and washing out for high school players outweighs the benefit of starting in the minors sooner, but in later rounds starting earlier could be the difference between making it to the big leagues or not. High school players who sign on will be foregoing college and thus will be able to dedicate more time to baseball. Finally, we will investigate the time from draft to debut among players. Here we will be using the debuts data set in addition to the draft data set. Also, we will only consider players drafted from 2005-2010, since 2005 is the earliest year for which we have debut information. From the above density plot, we can see that high school players tend to debut 2-3 years after college players. The distribution within each group is roughly symmetric and unimodal. The mean and median time to debut for all players is 4.63 and 4.23 years respectively. The 95% quantile of debuts times is 8.12 years, which we will use later on in our analysis as a cutoff time for censoring individuals. "],["models.html", "3 Models 3.1 Logistic Regression Model 3.2 Kaplan-Meier Curves 3.3 Weibull Parametric Model for draft to debut times 3.4 An analysis comparing debut likelihood using hazard functions and a Cox PH model", " 3 Models 3.1 Logistic Regression Model As a result of deciding that the censoring method would not work as a proper analysis for our question, we proceeded with the two step model. The first step of this model seeks to demonstrate a players probability of debuting in the major leagues based off of their position; whether they bat right handed, left handed, or as a switch hitter; and whether they were drafted in high school or college. Using the 16,727 draftees between 2005 and 2019, we were able to create the following logistic regression model. \\[\\log(\\mathrm{Odds}[\\mathrm{playing in MLB} \\mid \\mathrm{position}, \\mathrm{battingStance}, \\mathrm{highSchool}]) = 0.117 + 0.958 \\mathrm{HSdraftee}\\\\ + 0.82 \\mathrm{batsRight} + 1.009 \\mathrm{batsSwitch} + 1.375 \\mathrm{pitcher} + 1.068 \\mathrm{firstbase} + 0.851 \\mathrm{secondbase}\\\\ + 1.406 \\mathrm{shortstop} + 1.156 \\mathrm{thirdbase} + 0.9 \\mathrm{outfield}\\] This model has three significant variables - the right handed batting stance, the pitcher position, and the shortstop position. We can say with 95% confidence that the odds of a right handed batter making their big league debut holding position and whether they were drafted in high school or college constant are between 0.737 and 0.913 times lower than an left handed batter that is drafted. From our model, we also learn that outfielders and second basemen that are drafted tend to have the lowest odds of making their debut holding batting hand and whether they were drafted in high school or college constant. These variables are not significant, however, as the confidence interval representing their slope includes 1. On the other hand, the variables representing shortstops and pitchers are significant. With 95% confidence, we can say drafted pitchers have between 1.148 and 1.657 times the odds of making their major league debut compared to drafted catchers, and drafted shortstops have between 1.116 to 1.774 times the odds compared to drafted catchers (all holding batting hand and high school versus college draft status constant). With this model that accounts for all players drafted, we do not have evidence to conclude that high school draftees have a significantly lower probability of debuting than college draftees, as one might expect. However, in addition to this model we decided to create another logistic regression model for predicting whether or not a player will make their debut that only includes players that officially signed with a major league team and uses the same predictor variables. This model is based off of 2228 high school draftees that signed and 11,486 college draftees that signed, and the result is shown below: \\[\\log(\\mathrm{Odds}[\\mathrm{playing in MLB given signed} \\mid \\mathrm{position}, \\mathrm{battingStance}, \\mathrm{highSchool}]) = 0.134\\\\ + 1.64 \\mathrm{HSdraftee} + 0.808 \\mathrm{batsRight} + 0.918 \\mathrm{batsSwitch} + 1.314 \\mathrm{pitcher} + 0.991 \\mathrm{firstbase}\\\\ + 0.822 \\mathrm{secondbase} + 1.283 \\mathrm{shortstop} + 1.14 \\mathrm{thirdbase} + 0.84 \\mathrm{outfield}\\] As we can see from this model, being a signed player drafted in high school significantly increases a players odds of making their major league debut compared to a signed college player, as the 95% confidence interval represents a 1.45 to 1.859 increase in odds. This is much different than what we found when looking at all drafted players. Similar to the earlier model, the right handed batting predictor variable is significant - a signed player batting right handed has 0.722 to 0.903 times the odds of making their major league debut compared to left handed batters. The shortstop and pitcher positions are no longer significant variables. 3.2 Kaplan-Meier Curves The first type of model we will fit is a Kaplan-Meier curve, which gives us a non-parametric estimate of survival. Since it is a non-parametric model, it makes no assumptions about the underlying data and is very flexible. The way that the values on the curve are calculated are through reasoning in a conditional way: at every time point where a failure occurs we ask how many individuals survived past that point out of all the individuals that made it to that point. The below plot shows two separate Kaplan-Meier curves for high school and college players who debuted. We see that the survival curve of college players is lower than that of high school players, reflecting that they debut earlier them. However, starting at about 1500 days, or about 4 years, the gap between the curves is decreasing, which reflects the high school players catching up to the college players and debuting at a higher rate then them. The estimate of mean survival time is given by the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve. Here, the mean survival time is 4.06 years for college players and 5.27 for high school players We can also create Kaplan-Meier curves based on position: These curves show that third basemen have the shortest times to debut, and second basemen follow a similar trend starting around day 1,000. On the other hand, catchers take the longest time to develop and debut. 3.3 Weibull Parametric Model for draft to debut times In addition to modeling the draft to debut times with the Kaplan-Meier curve, we also decided to use a parametric model. Unlike Kaplan-Meier curves, parametric models make certain assumptions about the distribution of the data. A benefit of parametric models is that you get smoother curves that have equations which allow you to estimate risk at certain time points and more easily compare groups within data. Cox-Snell residual plots are one way to determine how good a parametric distribution is for what you are trying to model. If the plotted points appear linear with a slope of one, the model is likely a pretty good fit. We compared exponential, log-normal, normal, and weibull parametric models using Cox-Snell residual plots and found the weibull model to best fit our data, as seen by how closely our transformed data points fit the linear line. After determining that the weibull distribution is the best way to model our time to debut data, we also assessed which variables to include as explanatory covariates in our model using a Likelihood-Ratio Test (LRT) and Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC). These tests carry out a procedure of formal hypothesis testing to evaluate how well the model fits the data. When analyzing the distribution of time to debut data using only players that debuted between 2005-2011, we found the weibull model using predictors of position and whether the player was drafted in college or high school to be the best model. With Akaikes Information Criterion we received very similar results, however, this test concluded that the weibull model that also includes batting hand (left/right/switch hitter) as a predictor was the best model. The reason that these two formal tests differ slightly with the same data is that the AIC does not penalize models with more covariates quite as much as the LRT. We used the AIC equation AIC=2P-2L, where P represents the number of parameters in the model and L represents the log-likelihood of the model. When comparing models, the model with the lower AIC is better. Therefore, we could increase the degree to which the AIC penalizes larger models to better match the amount that the LRT penalizes additional parameters by increasing the P coefficient. When selecting our model, we ultimately decided that we were fine with the extra parameter of batting hand and used the weibull model with covariates of batting hand, position, and whether the player was drafted in high school or college. The weibull curves using the data on players debuting from 2005-2011 are shown below: Similar to the Kaplan-Meier curves, the survival curve for high school players is above that of college players, indicating that high school draftees typically take longer to debut after being drafted. More specifically, the weibull model gives a mean time to debut of 1720.725 days (4.7 years) for college players and 2118.939 days (5.8 years) for high school players. These times to debut are slightly longer than those found by the Kaplan-Meier curves, but the message is the same - high school draftees will take about a year longer to debut after being drafted than college players. 3.4 An analysis comparing debut likelihood using hazard functions and a Cox PH model In addition to looking at Kaplan-Meier and parametric survival curves, we also created hazard functions in order to investigate how the time to debut differs between high school and college players and at different positions. In survival analysis, a hazard function gives the risk of failure at a certain moment given that failure has not yet occurred. In our analysis, that failure is actually the success of a player making their major league debut. We used log-normal hazard functions to model the difference in the likelihood of a high school versus college draftee making their debut at any given time point because log-normal hazard functions are flexible in that they are able to be non-monotone in shape. The hazard plot is shown below: We see from this hazard plot that the college draftee hazard curve lies above the high school draftee curve, meaning that the college players are more likely to make their debut at any given time. Taking the the ratio of the curves at a given time represents how much more likely college players are to debut at that time in comparison to high school draftees - for example, at 1500 days (4.1 years), we can approximate that a college draftee is about 1.6875x more likely to make their debut that day than a high school draftee if they have not already debuted. We can see that from the curves the ratio starts out small then grows larger (at around 1000 days college draftees are about 2x as likely as high school draftees to make their debut on a given day), then decreases again. We can exponentiate the high school coefficient of the hazard function to find on average how much more likely a college draftee is to make their debut than the high school draftee across all times, and get 1.369. However, we should take this with a grain of salt. A problem with these hazard functions is that they tend to become more inaccurate sometime after the 1500 day mark. The curves will never meet/cross, implying that college players are always more likely to debut than high school players. However, we know this is not true. From our logistic regression model based on over 16,000 draftees, we saw there was no significant difference in the probability of a college draftee making it into the MLB compared to a high school draftee. One way to solve this situation and better assess the difference in risk of a debut at any given time was to fit a Cox PH model for the data and then look at the plot of the hazard ratio overtime that is true to the data (no assumptions are being made like with the log-normal hazard functions). This plot is shown below: We interpret this plot by look at the beta(t) for the high school covariate overtime. For example, at around 1200 days after a player is drafted, beta(t) = -0.5. We interpret this by taking 1/exp(-0.5) and get 1.649, meaning that at 1500 days we estimate that a college draftee has about 1.649x the likelihood of debuting that day compared to a high school draftee. This is very similar to what we got at 1500 days using the hazard ratio. However, at larger times this ratio becomes essentially 1. At 1800 days after the draft, beta(t) is almost equal to 0, implying a ratio of 1. In other words, players drafted in high school and college have the same likelihood of making their debut at 1800 days after being drafted. This is the reality, so this model is probably our best bet at estimating the true hazard ratio of debut on a given day between high school and college draftees. We also created hazard functions to compare the probability of players at different positions debuting at a given time. Because there are seven curves, this graph is a bit harder to interpret than the hazard plot for high school versus college draftees. The message from this plot is similar to the Kaplan-Meier curves modeled by position. From the Kaplan-Meier curves, we saw that third and second basemen tended to have the shortest time until debut after being drafted, and that catchers and outfielders tended to have the longest. This is depicted in this curve: at a given time, third basemen have the highest risk of debuting, and catchers have the lowest. For example, at 1000 days (2.73 years) after being drafted we can estimate that a third basemen has about twice the likelihood of debuting that day than a catcher. This ratio appears to fall as time increase after 1000 days. Again, just like the high school versus college draftee hazard plots, there is the limitation that the curves do not cross or become equal at a reasonable time, so we should only use these plots to assess the difference risk for the time period somewhere around 500-1500 days after a player is drafted. "],["conclusion.html", "4 Conclusion", " 4 Conclusion At the conclusion of this project, we have shown that it typically takes a high school player about a year longer than a college player to debut after being drafted, given that both players debut. Additionally, we have seen that catchers tend to take a longer time to debut after being drafted than other positions, while third basemen and second basemen tend to take a shorter time to debut after being drafted. One limitation to this work was that we only used date over a period of 6 years because we decided to work with only players that made their debut. As a result of this, for some positions we have a lot more observations than others. Additionally, we were limited on the variables that we could have used as predictors in our model. The data that we used contained some stats for the players that reached the major leagues, but we did not have minor league statistics for these players. In the future, it could be really interesting to see how a good or bad minor league season impacts a players time to debut or their probability of making a major league debut. As more data has become available within major league baseball, strategy and planning has become an increasingly important part of having a successful team. Overall, we hope these results can be useful for teams as they plan for their future seasons and decide which players to draft and when. "]]
