[["index.html", "Survival Analysis Project Overview 0.1 Motivation", " Survival Analysis Project Corey Pieper and Erin Franke 3/10/2021 Overview In this project we conducted a survival analysis of the time from draft date to debut date for major league baseball players. Our analysis specifically focuses on the variables of fielding position and whether a player was drafted in high school or college, and how these differences change a players time from draft to debut. 0.1 Motivation An analysis of the period of time between a players draft date and their MLB debut date can help major league teams better prepare for their future seasons. Among players who reached the majors, we estimated the average length of time between a players latest draft date and their MLB debut date to be 1667 days, or 4.56 years. Therefore, when professional teams are drafting their players, they generally need to be planning for what they want their organization to look and play like at least four to five years later. If these teams have a better idea of how long it usually takes between the draft and debut date for high school players in comparison to college players, they may have a better idea of who to scout and draft when rebuilding their farm system for that future championship team. This planning can additionally be more accurate when taking into account position, and analyzing how there are differences in average time to debut between players at different positions.

Witnauer, Rogers, and Onge studied the career length of baseball players with respect to their age at the start of their career and what decade they played in. Smith and Christensen assessed psychological skills in minor league players and found that they were predictive of current performance and later survival in major league baseball. Besides published research, many others have carried out their own statistical analyses of baseball. The relationship between career length and batting / throwing hand were examined in a blog post by Micah Melling using Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards model. He found that switch hitters had a much higher survival curve than other hitters, and left-handed hitters had slightly higher survival than right-handed hitters. In another interesting analysis, Scott Spencer studied how long a starting pitcher lasts in a game and looked at performance factors such as runs and baserunners allowed. 1.2 Data Sources The data set we used for our analysis combined two data sets, one containing information on MLB drafts and another containing information on player debuts. The draft data set has data on drafts between 1965-2019 and can be found here on GitHub . This data itself was compiled from the MLB Data API. The debuts data set lists players debuts between 2005-2019 and was manually put together using data from Baseball Reference. 1.3 Data Cleaning As with any statistical analysis, a significant amount of time was spent getting the data in a usable form. Only the June Amateur Draft is included in our analysis and players drafted since 2005 in order to match the debuts data set. Since far more players are drafted than the number that reach the majors, we left joined the MLB draft data with the debuts data. In addition, because players can be drafted multiple times, we took the most recent draft date for each player.
